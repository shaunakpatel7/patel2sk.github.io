                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75"> You can hear Neon-soul and R&amp;b coming from Brian’s keyboard most days of the week. A senior at James Madison University, he is a vocal student who studies music industry. When he isn’t in class, he devotes most of his time to writing, making, and performing music, saying he probably spends half his week making music. He was raised by his grandparents and mother in Warrenton, VA but currently resides in Culpeper, VA. In the past, he has performed at many open-mic events, shows and has released a lot of original songs. For Sauerwald, music has no fault. He began playing guitar at age 11 and has been singing forever. He recalls singing in the car as a kid and his 7th grade talent show was a big moment for Sauerwald because it was the first moment he realized people liked to hear him sing. He called it a “no-brainer” when he decided to pursue music.</p>
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                       As a student at JMU, his friends and teachers really inspire him and are great resources to learn from. “A guitar is just a guitar, or my voice is just my voice, but they teach me how to use it or how to live through it.” Other students at JMU are also friendly competition. He remembers thinking he was a “pretty good” musician and then came to JMU and was amazed at all the other music students. But these other talented artists make him want to push himself harder and be a better singer and songwriter. He even jokes that if he gets an inspiration for a new piece of music, he will stop what he’s doing, even if it’s homework, to follow the thought.</p>
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                       While in college, Sauerwald has a part time job to have a source of income. When asked what his biggest hardship was in music, he instantly said making money. Sadly, it is not a career that has cash easily flowing, but that doesn’t stop Sauerwald. He tries to keep his jobs within the music field and currently does recording in the sound booth of the Forbes Performing Arts Center at JMU. This job teaches him more about recording and he gets to work alongside Tom Carr who he looks up to and called the “guru of sound” and a “genius.”</p>
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                       One of his biggest inspirations is John Mayer. He has childhood memories of him listening to his albums at the bus stop and said, “he is very honest with his music and his words.” Sauerwald even has a tattoo of the initials “J.C.M” on his left bicep dedicated to Mayer.
                       Outside of music he enjoys his classes and video games. He even originally wanted to be a video game designer, but music is his life’s passion. He tries to balance his life between music and school and friends, but he acknowledges it’s easier said than done. In the future he hopes to continue pursuing his music career and has potential plans to move to Nashville which he calls the “songwriting Mecca.” He noted that his goal isn’t really to be a top tier musician anymore like the big artists because there are still amazing artists in the “B and C” tiers and it may take less toll on his mental health. He’d rather have a loyal fanbase at the lower level.</p>
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                       His advice to those who wish to pursue a career in music is, “don’t stop doing it because it is what we loved in the first place.” He admits it’s really hard and may lead to being broke, but a break will find you eventually. For Sauerwald, it’s hard for him to find something he doesn’t like about music. “Even when it’s bad, it’s still like I’m doing what I love to do.”

                            “My general purpose in life is to help people.”</p>
                          <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">Gihad Salih, 22, is the first-born American in a long linage of a Sudanese family. However, comparing his childhood Northern Virginia home to a ‘mini Sudan’, one could say his ancestors’ country still consumes a huge chunk of his life. With that, Salih is aware of the injustice and unrest happening over 6,000 miles away with Dictator Omar al-Bashi.</p> 
                          <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75"> Salih knew he had an opportunity to connect the two cultures and create change with one common medium: music.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “The basic amenities that we have here, that they [Sudanese people] don’t have there and realizing that there’s a disparity between life here and life there, at a young age,” Salih said. “That helped me form that purpose of I want to help people that don’t have as much as I have.”</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            Salih started writing when he was a freshman in high school just a decade ago. His rhymes started as journal entries, short poems and a space for him to self-reflect. He almost never shared the words he was curating.</p> 
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            Over the years, he put the phrases to beats but would only share his music to a select number of close friends.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “The type of feedback that I was getting is what made me take the next step with music,” He remembers. “It wasn’t just ‘Oh, this is good.’ It was ‘Yo, I listen to this, and I relate to this. This is music that inspires me.’” </p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            Transiting into his secondary education at James Madison University, he started writing more and more. He released his first SoundCloud song his sophomore year.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                             Since then, G-Salih (rap name), has released singles such as “OTW,” “Bloom,” “Prominence” and “4AM Flows” as well as a few freestyles and features. His first EP is set to drop on December 16. A short album of six songs he describes to be a ‘snapshot of his life right now.’ </p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            After walking across the stage in front of Wilson Hall this past May, draped in purple, he completed hundreds of full-time job applications with music still in the back of his mind. </p> 
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                                “My dad always says, ‘stay open minded. Don’t ever close an opportunity or close a gate.’”</p>

                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            He applied to jobs that if he weren’t going to pursue music, they would be his dream job. Such as a social consultant at a company called Global Impact in Alexandra, Virginia.

                                He got in.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “No matter what the option was, I can create an optimal outcome for each one,” He thinks back on deciding between the pros and cons on taking a corporate job or following music. “My gut was telling me to not take anything and focus on music and how much you can build it, focus on your passions at this time of your life and then see where it takes you.”</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            This was his motto until him and a few friends were talking down the streets in Georgetown, D.C. There were homeless people at each corner and one man sitting on a cardboard box with raggedy and ripped clothes approached them.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                                “We didn’t have any change, we usually carried cards,” Salih remembers.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                                The man didn’t want money. He wanted a conversation.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            He stressed that he goes through a lot of hardships, from going from soup kitchen to soup kitchen or dealing with the poorly ran homeless shelters. The biggest challenge he faces although, is being looked at as less than a human being. </p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                                That was it. </p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            Going back to his roots of always wanting to help people, Salih and his friends decided to combine a non-profit and a clothing brand. They would call it Human International. 
                                                      </p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “On every tee it says Human. The first thing you see when you see someone is human on their tee and that’s the first label,” he said. “Before it’s their race, their culture before it’s their religion, before they can even say a word to you it’s human.”</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                                The clothing brand gives some proceeds to different charities from each order.</p>

                            The clothing company, features and touring is what keep G-Salih on his feet and secure finically. But it’s his passion that keeps his in motion each day. “I’m on a mission in terms of I know how hard it is to crack into the music industry and how bad I want it,” he said. “So, I do balance my social and my personal life and my music and my business but for me, for now, the work that I’m doing is a little bit more important because I’m trying so desperately to make it. So, it’s more like work now, have fun later.”

                          <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75"> About 15 years ago, a couple of friends from the valley decided to form their own band … little did they know they’d become famous in a small town … and far beyond. Just a couple of friends who enjoyed hunting out in the western part of Virginia are now opening up for some of the biggest names in country music. </p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                                The Hackens Boys are a five-member band that resides in Rockingham County, Virginia. Although many members of the original band have come and gone and have swapped out with new members over the years, keeping the band going is important to these small-town musicians. The band has come a long way since its start and one could say they are in the thick of their biggest rise to stardom, right now.</p> 
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            Recently, The Hackens Boys have opened up for some of country music’s biggest names such as Morgan Wallen, Dylan Scott and Seaforth. However, just being the opener doesn’t always pay the bills at home. With many of the band’s members married with children — they all work other jobs outside of their music career.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “I’m a chicken farmer and I’m poor as shit,” the lead singer Spencer Wenger said. “But I plan my farm job around my music because music is what I want to do.” 

                            Other band members work as contractors, sheet metal specialists, construction workers and for the Rockingham County government. However, Wenger seemingly works the most unique job at the farm.</p> 
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “I get there around seven every day,” Wenger said. “You have to walk through our six chicken houses … I pick up the dead ones because there’s like 38,000 in a house and make sure nothing’s broken and all the ventilation and fans are working, and then I feed the chickens.” 

                            Although everyday life may not be so glamorous for The Hackens Boys, the life they live on the road is much more extravagant. From drinking with the boys every day to the slew of people you get to meet, life as a musician has its perks.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “I’m the youngest one in the group by 10 years,” Wenger said. “But these are my best friends and we just enjoy playing together and hanging out.”

                            The music industry is a tough place to make it big. Those who do, are passionate beyond measure of their work, and although The Hackens Boys aren’t necessarily looking to “make it big,” they still put their music first.</p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “I don’t know if we’ll ‘make it big’,” Wenger said. “How do you define someone who makes it big you know? For all I know we’ve already made it big, but we’re just focused on playing shows and building a fan base.” 
                                The more people they meet and the more bands they open up for, the closer The Hackens Boys get to becoming a household name. Creating their own music and lyrics along with their traditional country sound has given them a loyal fan base. </p>
                            <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                            “We’ve been playing a lot at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville,” Wenger said. “Which is where all the ‘next big things’ play, so that’s cool for us.” 

                            With a new album, King of the Wild, just released, The Hackens Boys are well on their way to becoming an established country music band. However, even if they never get to be the main act they will always continue with the band, as they have become one of the most accomplished bands to come out of the Rockingham County/ northwestern Virginia. 

                            “It’s not something that’s gonna come easy,” Wenger said. “You’ve got to put in the hours and the time to practice, especially if you want to do original music. You've got to work on your writing and just dive into it as hard as you can.”</p>

                        Howdyshell supports his passion for music by performing alongside his brother and friends in their band.  However, like the majority of other musicians, he supports his wife and children financially by pursuing a variety of other professions. </p> 
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                        According to a survey conducted via the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013, musicians are the highest artistic occupation which comes as second form of employment.  Having more than one job as a musical artist is not only a commonality, but frequently, a necessity.  There are even blog posts such as CarrersInMusic.com which provide lists titled "The Best Day Jobs for Musicians." </p>
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                        For Howdyshell, growing up means adapting to a plethora of professions. 
                        
                        “Stability,” he said.  “It’s just all about growing up.”  His journey began with a job at Little Grill Collective, a restaurant in Harrisonburg, Virgina, which he then purchased with a group of colleagues. </p>
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                        After ten years managing Little Grill, he became the property manager of Agora Market, a downtown Harrisonburg marketplace for small businesses, and Ruby’s Arcade, the nextdoor arcade bar. </p> 
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">    
                        On Tuesday nights in Ruby’s Arcade, you can catch Howdyshell and his brother taking a break from music and running a different type of show: Bingo Night.  With great enthusiasm and a beer in hand, the two call out letters, numbers, and offer prizes to lucky card holders. 
                        
                        Finishing off his roster of jobs, Howdyshell also works within the Augusta County Public School System.  Obtaining this job was prompted by his daughter’s dentist appointment and the discovery of eight cavities in her mouth.  When he saw the bill reaching almost 2,000 dollars, he knew he needed to get a job that included health and dental insurance.  So, he joined the school system.</p>  
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">    
                        “Hallelujah,” he rejoiced.  “[With insurance from the school system] it only cost me a fraction.” 
                            
                        Howdyshell says he feels fortunate to live in a prime location for live music between the venue options in Harrisonburg, Staunton, and Charlottesville.  
                            
                        Playing a paid gig is exciting, he shares, until you realize you have to share the money with the rest of the band. </p> 
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                        “I had a gig at JMU… gave me a grand!  It was awesome!  You know, you're like, ‘Wow, here's 1,000 bucks.’  At the end of the year, I got a phone call from the IRS being like, ‘Hey, you gotta pay taxes on that cause you gave us your social security number...’  I had to prove to them that I was in a band and that the money got spread out amongst five people and it wasn't all mine. So, even when you get these paid gigs if you're not, like, prepared for it, you have to deal with the consequences…”</p>
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">
                        Howdyshell says the key to overcoming this is, “Don’t do it for the money.”  He plays for community.</p>  
                        <p class="modal-text mb-0 text-black-75">    
                        This community has become a family… literally.  Not only does he play alongside his brother, but he also met his wife, a violinist, through music.  Now, they teach their son and daughter the art.
